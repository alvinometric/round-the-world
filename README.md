# Round the world

My first project at Contentful. This is an interactive diary with an accompanying map for each of the entries (also known as "scrollytelling").

This project uses:

- Sveltekit
- [MapLibreGL JS](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js-docs/api/) for map rendering
- Map tiles by [Stamen Design](http://stamen.com), under [CC BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0)
- [Contentful](https://contentful.dev) to manage the daily entries
- SCSS for styles

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
