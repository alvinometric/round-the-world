  <h1>Round The World</h1>

  <p>
    In 1878, Andrew Carnegie (of Carnegie Hall and Carnegie Mellon University)
    decided to go on a world tour.
  </p>

  <p>
    During that journey, he kept a diary, which he then published as a book. I
    re-created an interactive version of selected entries from October 1878 to
    January 1879 for my first project at <a href="#">Contentful</a>.
